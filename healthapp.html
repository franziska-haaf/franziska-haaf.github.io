            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <p>Currently, there are different health apps for different clients that provide the same service. This
                leads to high maintenance and adaptation costs. A common app is now to be created for all existing and
                future customers - with individual customisation options. This will enable private health insurance
                companies to offer high-quality, user-centred digital document submission for their policyholders easily
                and cheaply.</p>

        <h2>About the Healthapp</h2>
        <p>The health app is a standardised app for private health insurance companies that enables them to offer
            document management for their users under <span class="quote">iOS and Android</span> without much effort on
            their part. The health
            insurance companies can have certain adjustments made, such as images, texts and different requirements
            for account creation. The health insurance companies then launch the app under their own name in the app
            stores.The new development of the uniform health app is currently taking place in cooperation with 2
            health insurance companies as current customers. Further customers are planned.</p>
        <p>The average age of those insured by private health insurance companies is 64 (as of 2015, source <a

            <h3>Qualitative interviews with clerks</h3>
            <p>Qualitative interviews with employees of a private health insurance company who take care of the
                processing of submitted documents.
                It was important to make the stakeholders understand that I think from the user's perspective and do not
                want to visualise the (complicated) processes of the health insurance companies for the users.</p>
            <p>I wanted to find out on how the clerks work, what the 'life cycle' of a document ( receipt, cost
                estimate, invoice, ...) is like. How the clerks react to queries from insured persons and problems. How
                long the processing normally takes. What technical options we have - what additional data can we get and
                send.</p>
            <p>The most important finding was, that a users <span class="quote">individual submissions</span> within a
                certain time frame are assigned to an individual case worker and processed collectively by them. The
                insured person then receives a <span class="quote">single settlement</span>. These dependencies must be
                presented in the app in a meaningful and understandable way.</p>

                <h3>In-app survey</h3>
                <p>I created a short, easy-to-answer survey for in the apps (iOS and Android). Care needs to be
                    taken when analysing the answers to the last question - when do users want to submit their
                    documents - as the survey pops up as only as you start the app and the user can't be notified
                    without opening the app manually. So a person who only submits at the end of the year would probably
                    only open the app at the end of the year and not see this survey.</p>
                <p>The answers (especially the requested functionalities) were subsequently evaluated together with
                    the PO and the stakeholders as to their priority. The most requested feature was the<span
                            class="quote">'digital return channel'</span>, i.e. the possibility to receive the
                    settlements from the health insurance company digitally via app. These are currently still sent
                    to the users by post. In the future, the settlements will also be sent digitally via the app
                    (when the users have given their explicit permission).</p>

                One feature that one of our customers would like to offer its insurants (and which, according to
                its own market research, is desired by the insurants) is to be able to view the personal tariffs and, if
                necessary, compare and change them. In the later user tests, we also found out that the users consider
                this feature to be positive, since they then do not have to 'search through the paper documents' to
                find out, for example, how much subsidy they get for glasses.

                target group was represented. The tests took place remotely due to the Corona pandemic. I participated
                as the interviewer as well as the PO and 2 stakeholders of the health insurance company.
                A questionnaire and tasks were prepared in advance, which the users carried out using the Figma High
                fidelity click prototype.
            </p>
            <p>The evaluation of the usability tests was evaluated and documented as a usability test report and

            <h2>Accessibility</h2>
            <p>As the target group got an average age of 64, special care was taken with offering good accessibility and
                checked in the entire process. The developers were also briefed to use all the options available to them
                in the iOS and Android development.
                In the usertests, for example, it was found that our end-users have difficulty with pure icon-buttons
                and prefer to have text-buttons.</p>
            <p>Currently, the app displays three steps with text + image as an introduction to the document scanning
                process. This means that a lot of support is needed from the employees in the current implementations.
                In the future, a different solution will be used, such as the (optional) possibility of showing overlays
                on the respective interfaces to explain which feature is where and what it does.</p>
