            <h2>What I do</h2>
            <div>
                <p>I am a traditional artist mainly painting with oil paints.</p>
            <p>I make card alters, proxy cards, tokens and general <abbr>TCG</abbr> (trading card game) related artworks.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Card Altering</h3>
            <p>Card altering basically means, that someone artistically modifies a Trading Card Game
                (TCG) card using paint, markers, or other.</p>
            <p>I only paint on original cards. Before I paint on a card, I prime the card to make sure the paint sticks
                to it and also to keep the card material safe from solvents in the paints.</p>
            <p>Every card is unique and an original. Once a motive is painted, I won’t paint the same motive again.</p>
            <p>Here are some progress pictures showing different stages of cards being painted:</p>

                    alt="A trading card is placed on a light-textured surface. The artwork shows a line-drawn figure with large, sweeping wings extending outward. The lower portion includes a hand holding what appears to be a staff or elongated object. The piece is in an early painted stage, with light washes of color and visible sketch lines."

                <img src="./assets/progress-images/angel-progress.webp"
                    alt="A wooden tabletop easel holds a small trading card on a clip. The card is being modified with painted artwork showing soft, light-toned wings and a partially rendered figure. To the left of the easel is a painter’s palette covered in mixed oil paints—mostly neutral tones like beige, browns, whites, and touches of bright colors such as red and blue. A thin paintbrush rests horizontally along the bottom edge of the setup."

                    alt="A hand holds a fine paintbrush and paints on a trading card attached to a wooden easel. The artwork on the card depicts a stylized face with pale skin, vivid red lips, and intense red eyes. The artist is applying detail to the lips. To the left is a palette covered in mixed oil paints in various neutral and vivid hues."

                    alt="A trading card lies on a flat surface while someone paints over it with a small brush. The card has a rough sketch of a face and hand drawn in dark lines over a lightly colored background, suggesting the early stages of a character illustration. The text area of the card remains partially visible beneath a layer of paint."

            <h2>Commissions</h2>
            <p>I do take commissions. Prices depend on the motive. E.g. if it’s a photo of your pet or a movie character
                or if it’s a custom motive I have to create a design for. If you want to know more - don’t hesitate to

                <div class="description">
                    <p>My name is Franziska, but everyone calls me Franni. I currently live in Cologne, Germany.</p>
                    <p>I have a Master's degree in Computer Science, and my regular full-time job is related to that.
                        However, art has always been my passion, and I have been making art ever since I was able to
                        hold a pen.</p>
                    <p>For many years, I painted traditional oil portraits of pets and humans. In 2024, I started
                        playing TCGs and discovered that people were painting on the cards. So, over Christmas in 2024,
                        I tried it myself and stuck with it! I started with border extensions on Lorcana cards, but now
                        I prefer doing full custom artwork.</p>
