            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <p>Information that inform about a location are normally located directly at the place and conspicuous for a
                greater audience. We want to research solutions that are also embedded at the target location, but offer
                themselves only to people who might be interested in it. Unobtrusive and attention-aware systems might
                provide a potential solution to this. We want to explore what (multimodal) modalitites work best for
                such systems. As a target location, we frame the topic in meetup situations in which a mixed group of
                people with similar interest, but varying backgrounds comes together at one location.

        <h2>About the Metal Plates</h2>
        <p>The prototype was developed in the context of my master thesis with the topic 'Examine the use of
            unobtrusive, interactive interfaces in a semi-public meetup situation'. The goal of the thesis was to
            explore the use of unobtrusive, interactive interfaces in semi-public meetup situations. The work was done
            with the research-through-design approach using iterative prototyping. A pair of interactive floor plates
            was iteratively
            created, offering a game for people interested in it.</p>
        <p>The floor plates can be categorized as an ambient interface.</p>

            <h3>Description of the rooms</h3>
            <p>Three spaces were evaluated. Netlight's previous Meetup event space, Netlight's future Meetup event space
                currently under renovation, and AWS (Amazon Web Services) event space in the Munich office.</p>
            <p>There are sitting areas in all rooms that enable visitors to retreat. The spaces have kitchen areas that
                provided drinks and food. The majority of visitors spent their time standing in the area of the kitchen.
                For talks that took place during the rest of the Meetup, chairs facing the projection area were
                available to the visitors.</p>

                <h3>Meetup observations</h3>
                <p>A total of 4 Qualitative Observations were conducted in the Meetup spaces described.
                    The aim is to identify and select a specific situation on the basis of which iterative prototypical
                    approaches for unobtrusive interactive interfaces in Meetup situations are tested.

                    It could be observed that the crowd at the Meetups is spread out in the room. Seating, foosball, and
                    food areas are all used. Conversation groups form, and at Meetups hosted by Netlight, single people
                    are
                    approached by hosts and initiated into conversation (with other people).
                    In contrast, at the AWS Meetup, some participating individuals who were supposedly alone engage in
                    themselves, as no organizers jumped into the role of " matchmakers." These isolated individuals sat
                    on
                    armchairs or sofas away from the hustle and bustle, eating and drinking. A more frequently observed
                    behavior was how isolated participants looked around, searching for a familiar face, strolling
                    between
                    the discussion groups, only to be again on their own at other quieter spots. This gave the
                    impression of
                    introverted personalities who felt uncomfortable placing themselves in the center of the activity or
                    seeking direct contact with strangers. These participants could very well be picked up and engaged
                    with
                    the space, especially in quieter areas such as seating areas, and ideally brought into contact with
                    other people.</p>

                    in front of the projection screen were replaced by rows of chairs for a panel discussion.</p>

                <h3>Lotus Flower Method</h3>
                <p class="secondary-text">The 'Lotus Flower Method', or 'Lotus Blossom Technique', is a creative method
                    designed for groups and
                    is used to deepen different solutions to a defined situation (for example, a problem or an idea).
                    The method can be executed with small sticky notes. </p>
                <p class="secondary-text">In this process, a situation is placed as the center of a 3x3 matrix of sticky
                    notes to generate
                    ideas for a solution approach. The surrounding sticky notes are still blank. These sticky notes are
                    now filled by the group with ideas on how to approach the situation. Subsequently, the (selected)
                    ideas generated
                    are placed in their own 3x3 matrices as a center point and again the empty slips of paper around
                    them
                    are filled with ideas. This process can now be repeated again if necessary.</p>
                <p>The Lotus Flower method was conducted at Netlight with seven participants, including people with UX
                    backgrounds and people who plan and/or deliver events.</p>
                <p>Since it was noticeable in the previous Meetup observations that there were visitors who did not
                    actively participate in the social events of the Meetup, the situation was defined here as 'person
                    does not integrate'. The method was used to find solutions to the problem of how to resolve this
                    situation with the help of unobtrusive interactive interfaces.</p>
                <p>The most interesting, and therefore most thoroughly considered by the method, were the ideas 'Laser
                    pointer', 'Quiz' and 'Dance Dance Revolution with light fields on the floor'.</p>

                <p>In the course of the workshop, participants also debated the situation "person does not integrate",
                    which was specified for the workshop. The participants were not asked to do this. In doing so, the
                    recruiters participating in the workshop informed about the situation that they regularly put people
                    in contact with each other at Meetups and thus integrate them through outside intervention. This
                    further confirmed the situation assumed by the Meetup observations.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>Inspiration</h3>
            <p>In the Lotus Flower Method workshop, the idea was compared to "Dance Dance Revolution." This is a dance
                game, which is operated with plates on the floor which show arrows in different directions. These arrows
                must then be activated with the plates when shown on the connected display. Another comparison that came
                up was the German children's TV show 'Tabaluga TV' where there is a memory task with ice floes on the
                floor that light up.</p>
