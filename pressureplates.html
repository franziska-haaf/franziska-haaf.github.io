            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <p>The social component is an important factor in Meetups. The majority of attendees value networking and
                want to build and expand social networks (<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3377811.3380333"
                                                             target="_blank">source</a>). But there are
                people at Meetups who do not actively participate in the social part of the Meetup. It was found that
                individuals who do not integrate often instead engage on their own and stay somewhat apart from the
                action, isolating themselves even more from the Meetup situation. These initial, social barriers should
                be overcome with the help of an interface, thereby bringing users into contact with other people.

        <h2>About the Pressure plates</h2>
        <p>The prototype was developed in the context of my master thesis with the topic 'Examine the use of
            unobtrusive, interactive interfaces in a semi-public meetup situation'. The goal of the thesis was to
            explore the use of unobtrusive, interactive interfaces in semi-public meetup situations. The work was done
            with the research-through-design approach using iterative prototyping. A pair of interactive floor plates
            was iteratively
            created, offering a game for people interested in it.</p>
        <p>The floor plates can be categorized as an ambient interface.</p>

            <p>Three spaces were evaluated. Netlight's previous Meetup event space, Netlight's future Meetup event space
                currently under renovation, and AWS (Amazon Web Services) event space in the Munich office.</p>
            <p>There are sitting areas in all rooms that enable visitors to retreat. The spaces have kitchen areas that
                provided drinks and food. The majority of visitors spent their time standing in the area of the kitchen.
                For talks that took place during the rest of the Meetup, chairs facing the projection area were
                available to the visitors.</p>

                <h3>Meetup observations</h3>
                <p>A total of 4 Qualitative Observations were conducted in the Meetup spaces described.
                    The aim is to identify and select a specific situation on the basis of which iterative prototypical
                    approaches for unobtrusive interactive interfaces in Meetup situations are tested.
                </p>
                <p>It could be observed that the crowd at the Meetups is spread out in the room. Seating, foosball, and
                    food areas are all used. Conversation groups form, and at Meetups hosted by Netlight, single people
                    are
                    approached by hosts and initiated into conversation (with other people).
                </p>
                <p>In contrast, at the AWS Meetup, some participating individuals who were supposedly alone engage in
                    themselves, as no organizers jumped into the role of 'matchmakers'. These isolated individuals sat
                    on
                    armchairs or sofas away from the hustle and bustle, eating and drinking. A more frequently observed
                    behavior was how isolated participants looked around, searching for a familiar face, strolling
                    between
                    the discussion groups, only to be again on their own at other quieter spots. This gave the
                    impression of
                    introverted personalities who felt uncomfortable placing themselves in the center of the activity or
                    seeking direct contact with strangers. <span class="quote">These participants could very well be picked up and engaged
                    with the space</span> , especially in quieter areas such as seating areas, and ideally brought into
                    contact with other people.</p>

                <h3>Lotus Flower Method</h3>
                <p class="secondary-text">The 'Lotus Flower Method', or 'Lotus Blossom Technique', is a creative method
                    designed for groups and
                    is used to deepen different solutions to a defined situation (for example, a problem or an idea).
                    The method can be executed with small sticky notes. </p>
                <p class="secondary-text">In this process, a situation is placed as the center of a 3x3 matrix of sticky
                    notes to generate
                    ideas for a solution approach. The surrounding sticky notes are still blank. These sticky notes are
                    now filled by the group with ideas on how to approach the situation. Subsequently, the (selected)
                    ideas generated
                    are placed in their own 3x3 matrices as a center point and again the empty slips of paper around
                    them
                    are filled with ideas. This process can now be repeated again if necessary.</p>
                <p>The Lotus Flower method was conducted at Netlight with seven participants, including people with UX
                    backgrounds and people who plan and/or host Meetups.</p>
                <p>Since it was noticeable in the previous Meetup observations that there were visitors who did not
                    actively participate in the social events of the Meetup, the situation was defined here as 'person
                    does not integrate'. The method was used to find solutions to the problem of how to resolve this
                    situation with the help of unobtrusive interactive interfaces.</p>
                <p>The most interesting, and therefore most thoroughly considered by the method, were the ideas 'Laser
                    pointer', 'Quiz' and 'Dance Dance Revolution with light fields on the floor'.</p>

                <p>In the course of the workshop, participants also debated the situation 'person does not integrate',
                    which was specified for the workshop. The participants were not asked to do this. In doing so, the
                    recruiters participating in the workshop informed about the situation that they regularly put people
                    in contact with each other at Meetups and thus integrate them through outside intervention. This
                    further confirmed the situation assumed by the Meetup observations.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>Inspiration</h3>
            <p>In the Lotus Flower Method workshop, the idea was compared to 'Dance Dance Revolution.' This is a dance
                game, which is operated with plates on the floor which show arrows in different directions. These arrows
                must then be activated with the plates when shown on the connected display. Another comparison that came
                up was the German children's TV show 'Tabaluga TV' where there is a memory task with ice floes on the
                floor that light up.</p>

                        prototype, the second persona 'Kumar Rani' is particularly relevant and is considered the target
                        group.</p>

                    <h3>Prototyping</h3>
                    <p>The prototype 'pressure plate' was refined over several iterations. The first iteration mainly
                        tested whether users understood the interaction itself. In the second iteration, the prototype
                        was revised to appear more stable, provide ambient light, and present an icon to indicate use.
                        In addition, a duplicate was created to implement the intended use of a game. In the third
                        iteration, the panels were made of metal and now communicate with each other using the UDP
                        network protocol to enable the aforementioned game. In the fourth and fifth iterations,
                        customizations for better affordance, such as icons and a score display of the game state
                        represented by LEDs, were added.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h3>First Prototype</h3>
                    <p class="quote">Two wooden plates were covered with aluminum foil, and a spacer between them
                        ensured
                        that the plates only touched when pressure was applied, thus closing the circuit and causing an
                        LED to light up.</p>
                    <p>Guerilla Tests revealed that some users were afraid of damaging the Interface.
                        Since the parts of the electronics were freely visible next to the plate and this seemed to
                        unsettle the users, the plate was modified in a further step so that the LEDs could be stowed
                        away in a hole
                        on the underside of the prototype. With the help of a Plexiglas plate, which was also mounted on
                        the
                        underside, an ambient lighting effect was created around the printing plate.
                    </p>
                    <p>With regard to the selected Meetup situation and the desired purpose there - bringing
                        participants
                        who are not yet integrated closer together socially and communicatively - it was also decided to
                        create two panels that can communicate with each other. In addition,
                        a meaningful use case still needs to be found instead of the individual LEDs.</p>

                        prototype underwent several adjustments: Two panels in a larger format were produced and the
                        light was installed on the side to maintain the ambient lighting effect. The parts were made
                        using a laser cutter and engraved with a light bulb symbol.</p>
                    <p>ESP8266 microcontrollers were used to enable the boards to communicate via wireless LAN.
                        A fundamental goal for this iteration of the prototype was to improve affordance - that is, to
                        find ways to make the plates' modes of interaction easier to understand and to make users less
                        reluctant to interact with them.</p>

                <h3>Third Prototype</h3>
                <p>Based on the experience with the second iteration of the prototype, it was decided for the next
                    iteration to create the plates out of metal. The aim was to make the plates appear more
                    high-quality, more stable and less susceptible to dirt, thus counteracting inhibitions among users.
                    The construction plan for this prototype is the same as for the previous iteration.
                    The intended use is a game in which two users each operate a plate. Thanks to the Wifi-enabled
                    ESP8266 microcontrollers, the boards can communicate with each other via the UDP protocol in a
                    shared Wifi network.
                    The LEDs of both plates display different colors in a random rotation. If both plates show the same
                    color, the users have to actuate their respective plate as fast as possible. The user who presses
                    his or her plate faster wins the game. The plates show a light animation for the winner and for the
                    loser.</p>
                <p>The plates were again created in a larger format, so that in this iteration people with larger feet
                    can also press the pressure surface with their whole foot. The microcontrollers are placed at a
                    greater distance from the plates thanks to longer cables.</p>

                <h3>Guerilla Testing</h3>
                <p>The <span class="quote">first prototype</span> was tested with Guerrilla Testing. For this purpose,
                    the
                    interface
                    was laid out in the common area of the Netlight company and kept under observation. People were not
                    actively made aware of the board or persuaded to interact.</p>
                <p>Some people interacted freely with the Interface and activated it with their foot without
                    instruction.
                    Some people were afraid of damaging the interface. This led to a further modification of the
                    interface.
                </p>
                <p>Further guerrilla tests showed that the plate was partially not triggered because the non-clickable
                    edge
                    was in the way. This suggested that the plate was not big enough. Some users also pointed out that a
                    hint on which interaction to perform would be helpful for them.</p>
                <p>The guerilla tests have also shown that people present did not immediately take notice
                    of the printing plates, but only on the third or fourth occasion. One reason for this could be that
                    people in this specific work environment have little need to look down when communicating or
                    carrying
                    out their activities, but instead direct their gaze to coworkers or workstations. However, in the
                    previously described meetup situation that is the focus of this paper, it is precisely this
                    placement on
                    the floor that turns into an advantage: presumably, a characteristic of our user group is a limited
                    or
                    differently oriented radius of vision because they are sitting, reading informational materials from
                    the
                    event or on their smartphones, or looking at the premises. This is in contrast to those who have
                    already
                    made a social connection and are communicating with other participants.</p>
                <p>Guerilla Testing with the <span class="quote">second prototype</span> showed that this prototype also
                    had
                    the problem that
                    the pressure area of the plate is somewhat too small when users want to place their whole foot on it
                    to
                    trigger it. The ambient light proved to be effective and increased the perceptibility of the LEDs.
                    It
                    also became clear that users are still afraid of damaging the plate when they step on it.</p>

                    <h3>User testing</h3>
                    <p>After the first of the following user tests, the plates were slightly adjusted to solve
                        mechanical
                        difficulties. During the usage study, it was found that the plate surface on which users applied
                        pressure with their foot could slip inside the surrounding frame and unintentionally close the
                        circuit by touching the frame. This regularly triggered a pressure signal that was not caused by
                        the
                        users. The edge of the pressure area was therefore insulated with non-conductive adhesive
                        tape.</p>
                    <p>Due to the Corona measures, no qualitative user tests could be carried out in real Meetup
                        situations.
                        Therefore, qualitative single and double tests were used, which were feasible according to the
                        measures. At the beginning, before the exploration with the prototypes, a questionnaire was
                        filled out together with the participants.
                        Afterwards, the users were allowed to explore the panels without further instruction.</p>
