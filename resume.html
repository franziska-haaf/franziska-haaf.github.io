                <p>I am a UX designer who thinks that there is more to a successful user interface than a nice, modern
                    look.
                    For this, I rely on user-centered design methods to craft user experiences-from concept to execution
                    and
                    advocate the importance of user-centered design in all human-machine interfaces.</p>
                <p>Thanks to my technical background I understand technical requirements and limitations.</p>
