            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>The company Team Internet has various products. These products have different target groups and are
                partly based on different technologies. Future revisions or new interfaces should be based on Material
                Design. For this purpose, a central design system, the TI-design-system, was
                created in Figma, including
                a style guide, which contains all the important components. The product-specific design systems then
                inherit from this and overwrite adjustments specific to the products. In addition, the product-specific
                design systems contain individual components that do not apply company-wide.</p>

            <h2>Structure</h2>
            <p>Each Team Internet product has its own project in Figma. The design systems also have their own project.
                This includes the company-wide Team Internet Design System (+ style guide) and a separate design system
                for each product.</p>
            <p>Design files in the products then import the TI-design-system and the respective product design system.
                Importing the TI-design-system is necessary because not all components are revised in the product design
                systems.</p>

            <p>For the beginning of the style guide, the most important information from the Material documentation was
                summarised and added. The style guide was created as a living document to determine what should be
                included in the style guide in <span class="quote">iterative cooperation with the DEVs</span> of the
                various products. In the
                process, information requested by the DEVs, unknown concepts or necessary information are gradually
                added. Examples of styled components are always added as well as links to documentation (such as
                Material or Vuetify).</p>

            <p>Most of the products have existing colours. These were used but very reduced and simplified, as the
                colours were created for graphic design but are not so extensively needed in material.
                Colours were defined for both <span class="quote">light and dark mode.</span></p>

                of the existing website was used for short text parts such as headlines. The font structure from
                material 3 was used because it is more comprehensible than material 2 and defines more clearly what font
                is used for.</span></p>
