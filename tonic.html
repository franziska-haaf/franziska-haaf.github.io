            <h2>About TONIC.</h2>
            <p>TONIC. is formally called 'TONIC. for Advertisers'. It is a platform that enables the purchase of the
                advertising types 'POP' and 'Domain Redirect traffic'. In the future, a third option will also be
                offered which includes preconfigured ads of the advertising types 'Search', 'Native' and
                'Social'. POP, as the name suggests, is advertising in the form of pop-ups. Domain redirect traffic
                comes from landing pages that are displayed on parked domains.</p>
            <p>TONIC. provides two interfaces: one for 'normal' users - the internal advertisers - and since recently
                one for feed advertisers (which are maintaining their campaigns via API but set up certain things from a
                small extra UI). In this context, we are talking about the user interface for the majority of the user
                group - the internal advertisers.</p>
            <p>Users buy the existing traffic (POP and redirect) by creating and maintaining so-called 'campaigns'.
                Through the campaigns, you set the general conditions, for example, that you only want to buy clicks
                that fall under the area 'food' and come from mobile devices between 6 pm and 12 am because you want to
                sell pizza. The new ad type will offer preconfigured ads which will be purchasable via the
                so-called Marketplace in form of 'marketplace-offers'.</p>

            <h2>Research</h2>
            <p>As no research was ever conducted and an online questionnaire via newsletter remained largely unanswered,
                the
                users and their needs, wishes and problems are not really known. The account managers who are in contact
                with users know the biggest pain points, but no possibilities to address them.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Web analytics</h3>
            <p>We implemented "Matomo" for our current (and future) UIs for tracking user data in a way that is
                non-personal and data privacy compliant. Matomo gives us the opportunity to examine our site statistics
                in great detail. Which pages are visited for how long, with which end device, from which country, etc.
                Matomo has proven to be particularly valuable for analysing which currently implemented TONIC. Features
                are not used at all or rarely.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Qualitative interviews with sales</h3>
            <p>I started with qualitative interviews of our TONIC. sales people who are responsible for the users in
                form of account management and help desk. I wanted to learn how TONIC. does work, how users create and
                maintain campaigns and what their needs and problems are.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="row-container">
            <div class="row-70"><h3>Qualitative interviews with users</h3>
                <p>I conducted user interviews with experienced users via Zoom. In doing so, I had developers from the
                    team
                    with me to take notes so that they also got in touch with the users. I used a series of guiding
                    questions and had the users show me - via sharing their screen - how they work with TONIC. and where
                    it
                    is in their daily workflow.Â 
                    This revealed that they generally do not spend much time on the TONIC website. For some users, for
                    instance, they only login a few times a week. This is mainly due to the fact that the majority of
                    users
                    also use other (competing) products and the data of all products is fed into a combined tracking
                    tool
                    via API. When users log into TONIC, they do so to do things that their tracking tool does not offer
                    them, such as creating new campaigns or adjusting bids and daily budgets.</p></div>

                    We used templates that included the persona demographics, needs and how these needs are served.
                    We created 2 personas for Internal users (1 Media Buyer and 1 Affiliate) and 1 feed advertiser.
                    The personas where verified via the user interviews later on.</p>

                    important part of the product, I conducted a card sorting workshop with the TONIC.team. I wanted to
                    rethink the campaign creation process. This workshop also led to a discussion on whether we needed
                    all the objects and functions (blacklisting, whitelisting and source ID bidding) in the campaign
                    creation process at all. I then analysed this in the user interviews.</p>

                    second input. The user journey specially made clear that we have to look closer on the new user

                    Our focus is on the desktop view as only 6% of our users access TONIC via a mobile device. User
                    research
                    has also confirmed our assumption that the need of our users to use TONIC. mobile is almost
                    non-existent. Nevertheless, we want to make the mobile experience as good as possible and therefore
                    offer Responsive Design.</p>

                <h3>Click-prototype</h3>
                <p>I created a click prototype with the designs. In doing so, I represented the most important processes
                    - account creation, campaign creation, campaign detail view, campaign editing, etc. I also created
                    alternative versions for comparison where relevant.Â 
                    Details such as hover effects and animations through GIFs were also implemented to create as real an
                    experience as possible.
                    The prototype was later used in the user tests.</p>

                <p>In addition to the new design for the existing product, an important feature is the implementation of
                    a new ad type. I conducted a 'crazy 8' collaborative sketching workshop in which the scrum team,
                    sales and stakeholders participated. In this, the first design ideas for the display of the
                    inventory for the new ad type as well as the offer for individual offers were created. It turned out
                    that the best way for the new ad type would be to completely decouple it from the existing ad types
                    and therefore from the necessary campaign creation. The idea and the first designs for the TONIC.
                    Marketplace and its Marketplace offers were born.</p>

            <h3>Heuristic evaluation</h3>
            <p>One of the first things I did when I joined the team was a heuristic evaluation. I used heuristics based
                on ISO 9241-110 for 10. Most of the problems found could be solved by redesigning the UI, but existing
                problems, especially bugs, were solved according to their priority.</p>

                <h3>Usability testing</h3>
                <p>Usability tests were carried out using the high-fidelity click prototype. The tests took place
                    remotely
                    via Zoom. In addition to me as the interviewer, one person took notes in each session. There were
                    predefined questions and tasks. In conclusion, the interviewees were asked about their subjective
                    perception of usability using the SUS (System Usability Scale).</p>
                <p>The designs were very well received for the overall part, smaller feedback such as wording, the wish
                    for
                    a warning when leaving the campaign creation or the validation of individual source IDs when
                    inserting a
                    large list of source IDs into the blacklist or whitelist were made.</p>

                <p>Based on the results of the collaborative sketching workshop for the new ad type, a click prototype
                    with wireframes was created. It enables the comparison of the two workflows favoured in the
                    workshop. First, the bidding on individual offers with a 2-column view and second through a popup.
                    The prototype will be tested in guerrilla tests as a next step.</p>

            <h2>The end</h2>
            <p>
                Unfortunately, at the end of 2021, we received the news that our product <span class="quote">TONIC. was to be integrated
                with the competing product of a sister company for reasons of corporate strategy.</span> This happened
                shortly
                after the implementation of the first new designs.
                We had to stop our work and as a team we are very sad because we are convinced that with the redesign of
                TONIC we were going to provide our users with a new, user-oriented TONIC. that supports them even better
                in their workflow. TONIC. started under the name of 'DNTX' in 2012.
